                        <h2>RustCraft Mid Project Review</h2>
                        <p>
                            RustCraft has been by far the most advanced and educational of my personal projects to date.
                            It has pushed me to learning many new programming concepts from Graphics APIs to Entity
                            Component Systems helping me to understand the game engine pipeline more fully. As it has
                            been a learning process, I wanted to reflect on the decisions I have made this far and what
                            I would do differently with my new-found knowledge.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Rust</b><br>
                            I chose Rust because of my goal to achieve high performance with the project, as well as to
                            expose myself to lower-level languages and concepts to further understand the overall
                            software toolchain. This is one of the choices I am most happy with as Rust allowed me to
                            create a very robust codebase that was clean and exposed a safe interface to interact with
                            while not restricting my ability to heavily optimise.
                            <br>In the beginning of the project this decision seemed like a poor one as I had only used
                            Rust in a very limited capacity before. The borrow checking functionality of Rust made the
                            object-oriented approach I took to creating the engine very difficult. I managed to get
                            basic functionality working, however anything that required access to more than one variable
                            at a time meant that the project would refuse to compile. To solve this and many other
                            problems I settled on using an Entity Component System (ECS) for my core engine loop. This
                            would not only solve my Rust borrowing checker problems but upon reflection turned out to be
                            a large strength of the project, allowing me to compartmentalize every aspect of the engine
                            to provide a nice and simplified codebase. This is because I used an ECS to manage my core
                            render loop, not just the user facing objects. This means that to begin a frame I simply
                            dispatch the mesh building system, the texture system, the UI system and then finally render
                            the results to the screen. This worked especially well and meant that the entire engine well
                            utilised multiple threads.
                            <br>At the current point in the project my experience in Rust means that it is not taking
                            significantly longer to write than equivalent code in another language while still promising
                            safety and stability. I think the decision to use Rust for this project was a very good one
                            and one that has helped me to deliver one of the main goals of the project, to have
                            performant voxel rendering.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Vulkan-like wgpu-rs</b><br>
                            The graphics API used for RustCraft was a very important one, I wanted the flexibility to
                            create a highly compatible and performant voxel engine. These two attributes are hard to get
                            together, I looked through many of the graphics crates in the Rust library and settled on
                            wgpu-rs. It is essentially a wrapper over Vulkan, DirectX and WebGPU simply allowing code to
                            be run on all three of these API’s while still being low level enough to optimise for speed.
                            This was another major strength of RustCraft, usually porting engines to use multiple
                            graphics API’s and support web at all is a gigantic undertaking – however because of this
                            library RustCraft was able to run on the web, on desktops, gaming consoles and Linux!
                            <br>This was also a major change from what I am used to, previously only having used GUI
                            libraries such as that on Android. Having to allocate buffers manually and schedule render
                            passes led to me developing my knowledge of the graphics ecosystem significantly. The
                            decision to use wgpu-rs meant that I kept options for alternate platforms open, while
                            allowing for high amounts of optimisation and while being not as verbose as direct Vulkan. I
                            am very happy with this decision; however, it is one of the biggest challenges of the
                            project.
                            <br>If I were to do the project again, I would have approached the problem with more
                            planning and abstraction rather than the direct approach I have taken to storage. This is
                            especially represented in Mesh storage where instead of abstracting a mesh into a single
                            variable, it is spread over buffers, descriptors and assets which makes it messy and
                            overcomplicated to work with. Creating generic types like this that would be used around the
                            engine, and a more cohesive vision for how the graphics interacts with the rest of the
                            engine would increase the code quality.
                            <br><br>
                            I really enjoyed making RustCraft, from beginning to its current state it has taught me so
                            much and I can’t wait to continue learning in the future!
